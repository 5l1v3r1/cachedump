The file displays the inode number, total number of (4k) pages held in the cache, number of active pages, number of inactive pages, and the filename associated withthe inode for all dentries held in the cache. If zero pages are held in the cache that means there is a dentry but no inode.

ensure the kernel-devel pacakge is installed then run "make"

Bugs

Many :)
There is no locking done, I'd rather be inaccurate then slow kernel performance but this may be dangerous if a page is freed part way through us looking at it
its only been tested on the 3.10.0-514.21.1.el7.x86_64 kernel
it will probably crash your kittens and eat your kernel
